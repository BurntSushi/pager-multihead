It should be as straight-forward as

  sudo python2 setup.py install

Two configuration files, config.py and keymousebind.py will be copied to 
/etc/xdg/pager-multihead. 

To configure pager-multihead on a user basis, create ~/.config/pager-multihead
and copy /etc/xdg/pager-multihead/*py to that directory.

pager-multihead will require a restart if the configuration has changed.
